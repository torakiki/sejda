/**
 * Component that duplicates parts of the page resource dictionary that are relevant for the hit and clean process. The idea is that we want to hit and clean a resource dictionary
 * that is relevant only for the given page, and not potentially shared with other pages (e.g. if page is a copy we don't want to clean the resource dictionary of the original
 * page).
 * 
 * I'm not sure this is needed. Resource dictionaries may come from other places (XForm, ExtGState softmasks..) so we are already hitting/cleaning shared resource dictionaries. The
 * reason why the whole hit/clean process works is because the ExistingIndirectCOSObject holding the resources is unloaded from the LazyIndirectObjectsProvider once the file is
 * written, this way the next cycle reloads the resources getting a brand new resource dictionary, untouched by the previous hit/clean process.
