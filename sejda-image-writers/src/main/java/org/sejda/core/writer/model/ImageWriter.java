 * Interface for a writer capable of writing {@link RenderedImage}. A writer implementation is a statefull component which may or may not support write of multiple images on a
 * single image file. The writer has a lifecycle where a destination is first open, images written and the destination is closed. A writer is {@link Closeable} and once closed it
 * should not be reused, it's behavior is unpredictable once it's closed.
 * <p>
 * The writer is meant to be used in the context of a Sejda task and its lifecycle methods have a task parameter instance as parameter to allow the writer to perform adjustments
 * depending on the parameters specified.
